1 Background; Use of Third-Party Solutions.
1.1 AI features offer the capability to perform numerous tasks more efficiently and accurately, such as
analyzing data, creating content, making predictions and automating tasks. Because AI has such
tremendous potential to enable greater efficiency and expanded insights into data and communications,
Company intends to continue developing and introducing new AI features and functionality to its Services
to help You realize those benefits. However, AI is an extremely complex and rapidly evolving area that
presents numerous potential risks, limitations and restrictions related to issues such as confidentiality,
AI Use Terms and Notifications v. 2023.1 (231223) 2
Effective December 4, 2023 (CAN)
privacy, intellectual property and reliability, to name just a few. The purpose of these AI Use Terms is to
help You better understand those risks, limitations and restrictions so that You and Your Users can make
informed decisions regarding Your use of Company’s AI features and functionality, including whether to
use such features and functionality, how to use them and their outputs, who should have access to them,
and what types of data to share with them. By activating and using Company’s AI features and
functionality, You (a) agree that You and Your Users shall use the AI features in a secure, responsible
and confidential manner, in accordance with applicable law and regulations; (b) acknowledge that You
have been advised of and accept the risks, limitations and restrictions associated with using AI, including
without limitation those described in this AI Use Terms; and (c) agree that it is Your responsibility to
advise Your Users regarding the risks, limitations and restrictions related to AI features described herein.
1.2 Many of the AI-related services, features and functionality offered by Company are powered by
third-party AI solutions. Company attempts to identify and use leading third-party AI solutions, and
Company conducts thorough reviews of the security (of both the third-party AI tools themselves and the
infrastructure used to host and deliver them) and performance of such solutions prior to selecting the
third-party vendors to provide such services. In addition, Company will use reasonable care to securely
transmit to the third-party AI service providers the data that Your Users submit to the AI tools. However,
Company has no control over the quality or performance of such third-party AI solutions. Furthermore,
the data that Your Users submit to the AI tools (along with the output generated by the applicable AI tool)
will be stored, transmitted and processed by such third-party service providers (including without limitation
providers of the AI solutions themselves and providers of data storage for such information), and
Company has no involvement in the processes or practices that such third-party vendors use when
handling Your and Your Users’ data. Company therefore makes no assurances regarding, and
disclaims all liability and responsibility regarding, (a) the quality, accuracy and/or performance of
any such third-party AI solutions; and/or (b) the ability of the providers of such third-party AI
solutions to adequately and successfully protect the privacy and/or confidentiality of any of Your
data that You or Your Users provide to or receive from such AI solutions.
2 General Limitations of AI.
2.1 When using AI, You and Your Users should take into consideration a variety of disclaimers and
limitations to help enhance the safety, accuracy and effectiveness of the output of AI technology. This is
particularly relevant when using and relying upon content generated by Generative AI features.
Examples include:
(a) Potential for Errors/Inaccuracy: AI systems are not always accurate and error-free. AI
systems can make mistakes when processing and/or generating information, or the information they are
accessing may not be correct. For example:
1) The source data that is accessed by an AI system is generally a fixed set of data
as of a particular date. That source data may become outdated, and an AI
system will generate incorrect output if it relies on any such outdated data when
generating that output.
2) The source data that is accessed by an AI system may be incorrect. AI systems
generally refer to data available on the Internet, some of which may be factually
inaccurate. Reliance on any such inaccurate data will lead to errors in the output
generated in reliance on that data.
3) Even if source data is current and accurate, AI systems may not process or
interpret that data correctly, and the resulting output may therefore be misleading
or incorrect.
(b) Security Risks: Like any computer system, AI systems can potentially be vulnerable to
cyber attacks. Users should be cautious when using AI tools and should avoid sharing sensitive
information (such as confidential data or personally identifiable information) with AI systems, whenever
possible. Examples of potentially confidential or sensitive information may include:
AI Use Terms and Notifications v. 2023.1 (231223) 3
Effective December 4, 2023 (CAN)
1) Proprietary source code or product diagrams;
2) Passwords;
3) Lists or documents containing customer or vendor information;
4) Financial data or pricing information;
5) Personally identifiable information (or PII), such as individuals’ names, social
security numbers, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, or any other
data that can uniquely identify an individual;
6) Credit card or bank account information;
7) Employee data;
8) Copies of business contracts; and
9) Security information
(c) Bias Issues: AI systems are trained on particular sets of data. That training data may be
biased. As a result, the output from AI systems can be biased due to issues with the data on which they
are trained. Users of AI should be aware of potential biases and take steps to mitigate them, such as by
independently verifying statements or findings generated by AI tools.
(d) Legal Compliance: The legal and regulatory environment related to AI tools is constantly
and rapidly changing. Governments around the world are considering legislation that would restrict or
limit the ways that AI systems can function and can be used. In addition, the output of AI systems may
potentially violate the intellectual property or other rights of third parties, such as by not properly
identifying information that is owned (and whose use is restricted) by others and incorporating that
information into its output. Users must always be aware of these risks and the importance of using AI
systems and tools (and their output) in a legally compliant manner. When using a Generative AI tool to
generate computer code, for example, it is recommended to perform a code scan on the generated code
to identify security vulnerabilities and/or potentially problematic open source/third-party code before
incorporating such code into a company’s products.
(e) Ethical Considerations: AI systems may raise ethical concerns, such as potentially
violating privacy laws or regulations or reflecting discriminatory or offensive content. Users should ensure
that all output of an AI tool considers and evaluates the sensitivity and appropriateness of the underlying
data and does not use or embody data in an unethical manner.
In general, users should approach AI with caution and be aware of its limitations and potential risks. It is
crucial that users use AI responsibly, carefully review the output of any AI tool before using it, and take
steps to ensure that such tools are used safely and appropriately.
2.2 Certain third-party AI tools are structured to use the content of customer communications to train
their tools. However, Company has designed its AI-related services, and its use of third-party AI services
in connection therewith, with the intent of not using any of Your audio, video, chat, screen sharing,
attachments or other communications using Company’s Services, without Your consent, to train
Company’s or third-party artificial intelligence models.
3 AI Notifications Regarding Specific Company Services and Features.

(a) If You purchase Company’s Unified Communications Archiving (“UC Archiving”) service,
You and Your Users should be aware that (a) the UC Archiving service is configured to archive all
communications between Your Users and the AI Assistant (just as the service archives all of Your Users’
other chat communications), and (b) as a result, Your Account administrators will have the ability, by
AI Use Terms and Notifications v. 2023.1 (231223) 4
Effective December 4, 2023 (CAN)
accessing the archive of Your company’s chat communications, to view Your Users’ interactions with the
AI Assistant.
(b) The AI Assistant has contextual memory (i.e., the ability to access and reference
previous communications between a User and the AI Assistant), but that memory is limited to a small
number of previous communications (typically, the most recent three messages) and only for a limited
period of time. If a User wishes to reset the AI Assistant’s contextual memory, the User can do so by
entering “/newchat” into the chat box with the AI Assistant.
(c) Users are able to send URLs or other forms of web links to the AI Assistant, and the AI
Assistant may include URLs or web links in its output. Company does not scan such URLs or web links
for malicious code, inappropriate or illegal content, or any other harmful attributes, including without
limitation disabling devices, drop dead devices, time bombs, trap doors, Trojan horses, worms, viruses
and similar mechanisms (collectively, “Harmful Content”). Company expressly disclaims all liability with
respect to any Harmful Content contained in any URL or web link shared by or with Your Users via the AI
Assistant. You hereby release and agree to hold harmless Company from and against any damages or
liabilities of any kind related to any Harmful Content contained in any URL or web link shared by or with
Your Users via the AI Assistant.
(d) Company does not screen or filter the content of messages, links or attachments sent to
or by the AI Assistant (whether for offensive or illegal content, viruses or otherwise), and Company does
not modify any User content sent to the AI Assistant. As with all Services, You assume full responsibility
and liability for the legal and compliant use of the AI Assistant by Your Users. Company expressly
disclaims all liability with respect to any content, links or attachments included by Your Users or any third

the AI Call Summarization and redaction features. In addition:
(a) While Company uses reasonable efforts to identify and extract/redact personal, sensitive
or other confidential information from the call transcriptions, the AI-powered redaction tools may not
successfully identify and redact all sensitive and/or confidential information that is included in a call
transcription. As a result, sensitive and/or confidential information that is communicated during a call may
potentially be included in transcriptions and summaries of that call and may therefore be visible to
Account administrators, supervisors and coworkers that have access to such transcriptions and
summaries. In addition, any such sensitive and/or confidential information, if it is not successfully
redacted from a call transcription or summary, may be included in the database of information that is
made available to the Generative AI tool for future use and reference by the particular customer. Any
data that is submitted to the Generative AI tool by any participant in a summarized call or a transcribed

(a) The AI Support Bot will be able to access multiple sources of Company technical support
information to identify the desired answer to a User’s query. However, the data set to which the AI
Support Bot has access, and that is used to train the AI Support Bot, must draw data from multiple
different sources where the underlying content is posted. Because that data is dispersed in multiple
locations (e.g., Knowledge Base articles will be stored in one location/system, and Frequently Asked
Questions will be posted and stored in a separate location/system), instead of in one centralized location,
the AI Support Bot may not be able to look to multiple different data repositories and successfully identify
correct responses to a User’s query.
(b) Company will have access to review Users’ interactions with the AI Support Bot (both
queries and responses) in order to evaluate and help improve the accuracy and performance of the AI
Support Bot.
4 Service Limitations and Disclaimers.
4.1 Service Limitations. The AI tools, features and functionality offered through or in connection with
the Services are provided on an “as is” basis, and Company makes no representation or warranty with
respect to the availability, the effectiveness, the accuracy or any other aspect of the output or
performance of such AI tools, features and functionality. Use of the AI tools, features and functionality is
at Your sole risk. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary otherwise set forth herein, You hereby release
and agree to hold harmless Company from and against, and that Company will have no liability
whatsoever in connection with, any damages or liabilities of any kind arising out of:
(a) Any inaccuracies, errors, biases or offensive content contained or reflected in any output
generated by an AI tool, feature or functionality, regardless of whether such inaccuracies, errors, biases
or offensive content are the result of incorrect, outdated or biased source information, failures of the AI
tool to properly process source information and generate correct output, or any other reason;
(b) Any security incident impacting Your data that results from a failure by any third party
provider of AI-related services to adequately protect such data from unauthorized access, use,
misappropriation or other conduct;
AI Use Terms and Notifications v. 2023.1 (231223) 6
Effective December 4, 2023 (CAN)
(c) Output from any AI services, features or functionality that (i) violates any applicable law
or regulation; (ii) infringes on the intellectual property or other rights of any party; (iii) is subject to
restrictive licensing provisions or other restrictions or limitations that could negatively impact any party
that attempts to use such output;
(d) Any failure by a third-party provider of AI-related services to successfully segregate Your
data from the data of other users of the provider’s services; and
(e) Any failure of an AI tool to correctly identify and redact/remove sensitive or confidential
information from a summary, transcript or any other work product that it generates.
Company Service Level Agreements do not cover the AI features and services (for example,
unavailability of an AI feature or service does not constitute unavailability of the applicable Service in
which such AI feature or service is used, for purposes of the applicable Service Level Agreement of such
Service). Company does not offer a separate Service Level Agreement for the AI features or services.
You acknowledge and agree that the limitation of Company’s liability is a material term to Company and
that it would not otherwise make the AI tools, features and functionality available without this limitation,
and that You agree these limitations are reasonable.
4.2 Limitation of Liability. Company will not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special,
punitive or consequential damages, including but not limited to damages for lost profits, business
interruption, loss of programs or information, and the like, that result from the use or inability to use the AI
features and services or from mistakes, omissions, the AI features or services not meeting Your
requirements or expectations, interruptions, errors, defects, or delays in operation or transmission,
regardless of whether Company has been advised of such damages or their possibility. Company will not
be liable for any harm that may be caused by the execution or transmission of malicious code or similar
occurrences, including without limitation disabling devices, drop dead devices, time bombs, trap doors,
Trojan horses, worms, viruses and similar mechanisms. The warranty restrictions and limitations set forth
in this Schedule are in addition to the warranty restrictions and limitations provided for in the MSA. Except
as otherwise set forth in this Schedule, You agree that the total liability of Company and Your sole
remedy for any claims shall be as set forth in the MSA.
5 Fair Use Policy.
5.1 Company may offer AI features or services that are described as including unlimited use.
However, Company reserves the right to review usage of any “unlimited” plans to ensure Fair Use and
reserves the right to, at any time, take the actions noted in Section 5.2 below without notice to You. "Fair
Use" means that the total usage of the applicable Service (whether measured in terms of queries, volume
of content transmitted to or processed by such Service, or any other metric that reasonably reflects the
cost incurred by Company to deliver such Service) does not substantially exceed, in Company’s
reasonable judgment, the average use of all other Company customers as measured on a per user basis.
Usage and associated charges for excess usage will be determined based solely upon Company’s
collected usage information. Fair Use also prohibits any activities that result in excessive usage including,
but not limited to, automated queries, continuous or extensive recording of calls or meetings, mass
uploads of data, or any activity that disrupts the activities of Company and/or other Company customers.
5.2 If Your usage exceeds the limits for Your Account (if applicable) or otherwise exceeds Fair Use,
You agree that Company may immediately, in its sole discretion, (a) charge You for such excess usage
via Your automated payment account (or by invoice if You have been accepted into Company’s check
paying program), (b) upgrade You to a plan or increase the limits on Your Account to address this excess
AI Use Terms and Notifications v. 2023.1 (231223) 7
Effective December 4, 2023 (CAN)
usage, and/or (c) suspend Your Account or terminate Your Account upon notice to You. Upon any
upgrade or increase on the limits of Your Account, You will be responsible for the new costs and fees.

communications that may infringe the intellectual property rights or other rights of third parties, including,
but not limited to, trademark, copyright, patent or right of publicity; (c) to interfere with, disrupt, attempt to
interfere with or disrupt computer servers or networks connected to the Services or violate the

6.3 No Resale. The AI features and services are for Your use and not third parties. Except as set

and services may be restricted or limited as a result of Applicable Laws and that You will not use, or allow

that it is Your sole responsibility to use the Service in a lawful manner. Notwithstanding any other

with or without prior notice, for any reason, including without limitation as may be required or reasonably
deemed necessary by Company pursuant to any Applicable Law, including any order, rule or decision of
a Governmental Authority.
b. Fraud. It is the express intention of the parties that You, and not Company, will bear the
risk of loss arising from any unauthorized or fraudulent usage of AI features or services provided under

appropriate to prevent or terminate any fraud or abuse in connection with the AI features or services, or
any use thereof; provided, however, that any such action will be consistent with applicable federal, state
and local laws, rules, and regulations and provided further that the failure to take any such action will not
limit Your responsibility for all usage of the Services.

content of phone calls or online meetings and/or the processing of data from such recorded meetings.

change or discontinue any AI feature or service at any time, without notice, and does not represent or
warrant the result of any such action. Company may convert any AI feature or service to a paid service
upon notice to you.
