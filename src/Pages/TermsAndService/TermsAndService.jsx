              <p className="bold">
                AIBC offers AI-driven services such as chatbots, predictive analytics, and computer vision software. Our solutions leverage advanced algorithms to provide

              <p className="bold">
                Our services use machine learning models and AI systems to analyze data and deliver customized outputs. These outputs are based on probabilistic algorithms 
                and may vary in accuracy depending on the quality of the data inputs. These AI models are designed to augment, not replace, human judgment and expertise.
              </p>
              <h3 className="heading-primary">Service Limitations</h3>
              <p className="bold">
                While we strive for high-quality outputs, AIBC does not guarantee the correctness or reliability of any AI-generated results. Our AI models rely on input 
                data provided by users or publicly available sources, and may produce incomplete, outdated, or inaccurate information. Users are solely responsible for 
                verifying the accuracy and appropriateness of AI outputs before acting on them.
